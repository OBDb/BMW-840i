    description: "The BMW 840i is part of the second-generation 8 Series, which revived the nameplate after a 20-year hiatus. Available in three body styles: coupe (G15), convertible (G14), and four-door Gran Coupe (G16), the 840i features a 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 335 HP and 368 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through an eight-speed automatic transmission to either the rear wheels or all four wheels in xDrive variants. The 840i offers an impressive blend of performance and luxury, with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 4.7-5.2 seconds depending on body style and drivetrain configuration. The second-generation 8 Series combines elegant grand touring characteristics with modern technology, featuring a driver-focused cockpit with BMW's latest iDrive system, digital instrumentation, and advanced driver assistance systems. The 840i positions itself as a more efficient alternative to the V8-powered M850i, while still delivering engaging performance, refined handling, and the prestige of BMW's flagship coupe series. Its sophisticated styling, advanced technology, and balanced performance make it a competitive offering in the luxury grand tourer segment."
